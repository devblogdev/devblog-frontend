Warning:
Changing the folder name "PostEditor" to a lowercase version ("postEditor", "posteditor"),
will cause errors during production build as there will be modules with the names
"PostEditor" AND "postEditor"; some compiling programs do not differentiate between
the lowercase and uppercase names; for example, when pushing "postEditor" to GitHub,
the actual folder name will be "PostEditor", which will lead to some files not being found
during the production deployment making the production build to fail
